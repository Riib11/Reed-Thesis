[?] In what general area or areas of computer science would you like to write your thesis?

I would like to write within the general topic of programming language theory.

[?] If you have specific topics in mind, list them here, with some brief elaboration about the nature or scope of your proposed project.

More specifically, I would like to touch some of the following areas: formal verification, side-effects, mutable state, concurrent computation, and parallel computation.
As for the scope of my project, I would like to build a programming language that implements the language theory and design I outline in my thesis, as well as a sort of virtual machines to run its programs on (I don't plan on writing a compiler down to say, C or assembly).

[?] If you are an interdisciplinary major please describe the computer science components of your thesis. Interdisciplinary majors include: Computer Science/Mathematics, Computer Science/Neuroscience and Computer Science/Psychology and department approved ad-hoc interdisciplinary majors.

I will be doing a strictly computer science thesis.

[?] Include the names of professors with whom you have discussed these topics.

I have extensively conversed with Jim Fix about my thesis ideas as well as many of the topics I hope to include in it.

[?] List three potential advisers. Clearly indicate your degree of preference, if any.

In order of decreasing preference:
1. Jim Fix
2. Adam Groce
3. Mark Hopkins
