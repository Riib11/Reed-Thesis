\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Outline}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Definition of a simple, typed lambda calculus
  \item Context and definition of what \tit{effects}
  \item Explanation of how effects are handle'd in ML's style i.e. the program is strictly evaluated and effectual functions are treated like normal functions
  \item Explain how this style is not strictly functional, because it requires a globally-mutable and globall-accessible state that is carried along implicitly at run-time
\end{enumerate}
