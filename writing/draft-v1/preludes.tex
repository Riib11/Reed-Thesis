\chapter{Appendix: Language Preludes}
\label{app:preludes}

This chapter defines \ep{preludes} for a few of the languages presented in this work.
A \kw{prelude} for a programming language is a program implicitly included loaded before a program written in the language.
A prelude's purpose to provide some useful, ubiquitous structures that are expected by the programmer and would be a bother to define for every program.
These include
data types such as \code|unit|, \code|boolean|, and \code|integer|,
functions such as \code|compose|, and
type-classes such as \code|Equalable|.


Additionally, a language's prelude is inherited by its extensions.
For example, the prelude for \LangA is implicitly loaded as part of the prelude for each of \LangB, \LangC, \LangD, and \LangE.
