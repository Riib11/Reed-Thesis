Having multiple infixed notations for $\mvar{type}$s introduce inter-notational ambiguity.
For example, the type \code|$α$ → $β$ ✕ $γ$ ⊕ $δ$| has not yet been determined to associate in any one of many possible ways.
We adopt the following precedence order of increasing tightness to eliminate this ambiguity: \code| → , ⊕ , ✕ |.
So, the type \code|$α$ → $β$ ✕ $γ$ ⊕ $δ$| associates as \code|($α$ → $β$) ✕ ($γ$ ⊕ $δ$)|
