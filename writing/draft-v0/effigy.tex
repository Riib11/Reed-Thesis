\chapter{Effigy}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Explanation of motivations for a new language, incorporating the ideas of previous chapters
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item provides fully-type freer monadic effects (implemented in a language like Coq)
    \item user-friendly interfacing with effects, that degenerates to familiar monadic-effect syntax for single-level effects
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Specification of Effigy's syntax
  \item Correctness proofs for Effigy's implementation
  \item Demonstration of familiar examples in Effigy programs
\end{enumerate}
