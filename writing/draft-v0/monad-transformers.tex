\chapter{Monad Transformers}

\section{Outline}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Definition and context for monad transformers
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item provides a framework for sequencing different monadic effects
    \item introduces a higher-order monad that acts as an effect for sequencing lower monadic effects
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Brief explanation of monad transformers implementation in Haskell
  \item Discussion of advantages and disadvantages of monad transformers
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item facilitates general sequencing of different effects at the same level
    \item rigorously typed
    \item does not facilitate general composition of different effects; effects still must be handled at the level they are introduced
    \item are clunky to program with
  \end{enumerate}
