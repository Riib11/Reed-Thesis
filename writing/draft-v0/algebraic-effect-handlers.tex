\chapter{Algebraic Effect Handlers}

\section{Outline}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Definition and context for algebraic effect handlers
  \item Explanation of the Eff programming languages approach to implementation
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item subset of semantics
    \item examples
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Comparison of algebraic effect handlers to monadic effects approach
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item alebraic effect handlers allow for effects and handlers to be defined separately
    \item algebraic effect handlers and generally composable, however they must be carefully handled to match their internal composition
    \item Eff does not expressively type the effect system, and many features are untyped
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
